## Objectives

Before you can start working on the AppDynamics labs, you need to reserve a sandbox environment.  The sandbox environment for the labs will have two virtual machines.  The first virtual machine hosts the AppDynamics Controller.  The second virtual machine hosts the Supercar Trader application used in the labs and will be the host where you will install the AppDynamics agents.

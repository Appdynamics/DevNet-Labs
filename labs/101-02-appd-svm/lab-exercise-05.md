Explore the server main dashboard where you can:

- See charts of key performance metrics for the selected monitored servers, including server availability; 
  - CPU, memory, and network usage percentages 
  - server properties
  - disk, partition, and volume metrics
  - top 10 processes consuming CPU resources and memory
- Change the time period of the metrics displayed.
- See an assessment of the overall health of the server, as determined by whether any health rules have been violated. See 
View Health Rule Status in the UI. 
- See the hierarchy or grouping of the server as specified in the controller-info.xml using the machine-path configuration property.
- Click on any point on a chart to see the metric value for that time.
- Find and switch to other Server Dashboards (pull-down menu next to server tier, top left).
- View an aggregate of the top 10 processes by CPU usage, and top 10 processes by memory.

Intro:
This is a library to help add MQ message sending functionality to The Grinder.
The whole idea behind this was to make it easy to implement load testing with MQ messages. While 
org.rextency.mq library makes almost every MQ parameter adjustable, not all are.  
If you need to extend the functionality of the library, the source code has been included. If you 
make any changes and would like to have the changes submitted as part of the package please contact
me with the changes you have made.  Also, if there are any bugs you find in the implementation please
contact me.

Required Files:
The three JAR files not included, are IBM jar files.  If you have WebSphere MQ installed, then these JAR
files by default are located in:  x:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\Java\lib on a Windows machine.

Usage:
Simply add ALL FOUR JAR files to your Grinder agent classpath and everything should be smooth sailing.
I've also included a sample script to help get you started.

The Grinder is a load testing framework that makes it easy to run a
distributed test using many load injector machines. Test scripts are
written in Jython, and HTTP scripts can be recorded easily from a
browser session. The Grinder is freely available under a BSD-style
open-source license.

The Grinder's home page is http://grinder.sourceforge.net. This site
contains the latest version of the user manual for The Grinder.

The site also contains details of mailing lists that you might like to
join. In particular, if you have questions that are not answered by
the documentation, please try asking on the grinder-use mail list
(http://grinder.sourceforge.net/support.html).
